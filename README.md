Hi Somebody probably I don't know.

You can find here my Javascript learning journey.
This repository based on Jonas Schmeddman's Javascript course on Udemy.

In this repo you can see there are some small projects, coding challanges and also some little code pieces I do throught the course.

Projects:
-Guessmynumber(a number guessing game) -> can be accessed from /guessmynumber
-Piggame(dice rolling game) -> /piggame/starter
-Bankist(a simple model of internet bank application)-> /bankist
-BankistDOM(homepage for bankist app)-> /bankistdom
-Mapty(workout tracking application on interactive map)-> /mapty
